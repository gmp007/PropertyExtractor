10.1021/acsami.8b08609,"The availability of an accurate, nondestructive method for measuring thickness and continuity of two-dimensional (2D) materials with monolayer sensitivity over large areas is of pivotal importance for the development of new applications based on these materials. While simple optical contrast methods and electrical measurements are sufficient for the case of metallic and semiconducting 2D materials, the low optical contrast and high electrical resistivity of wide band gap dielectric 2D materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) hamper their characterization. In this work, we demonstrate a nondestructive method to quantitatively map the thickness and continuity of hBN monolayers and bilayers over large areas. The proposed method is based on acquisition and subsequent fitting of ellipsometry spectra of hBN on Si/SiO2 substrates. Once a proper optical model is developed, it becomes possible to identify and map the commonly observed polymer residuals from the transfer process and obtain submonolayer thickness sensitivity for the hBN film. With some assumptions on the optical functions of hBN, the thickness of an as-transferred hBN monolayer on SiO2 is measured as 4.1 Å ± 0.1 Å, whereas the thickness of an air-annealed hBN monolayer on SiO2 is measured as 2.5 Å ± 0.1 Å. We argue that the difference in the two measured values is due to the presence of a water layer trapped between the SiO2 surface and the hBN layer in the latter case. The procedure can be fully automated to wafer scale and extended to other 2D materials transferred onto any polished substrate, as long as their optical functions are approximately known."
10.1016/j.carbon.2018.04.089,"Understanding surface structure of graphene is important for its integration into composite materials. Here, we have used synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR) to study the structure of commercially available graphene samples (prepared via chemical vapor deposition, and marketed as graphene monolayers) on SiO2/Si at different temperatures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoemission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to evaluate the composition and morphology of the graphene layer. Our results indicate that the samples we characterized consisted of 3-4 layers of graphene, which should thus be more accurately described as few layer graphene (FLG). Furthermore, a contaminant layer, comprising polymethylmethacrylate and graphene multilayers, was found present atop FLG. We also report tentative results on the effect of temperature on the graphene sample thickness. At 25°C, the FLG thickness from XRR measurements was 13.0±1.0Å, in agreement with that obtained from AFM (13.9±0.7Å). Upon heating to 60°C, the FLG thickness expanded to 13.8Å, which further increased to 14.3Å upon cooling to 25°C. We attribute this temperature dependent thickness to the out-of-plane rippling of graphene as previously reported. These unprecedented results on the FLG surface structure are valuable to its potential bioanalytical applications."
10.1021/acs.est.1c02363,"The distinctive optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) make it a promising photocatalyst and photothermal agent in aqueous applications. In terms of environmental stability, MoS2 has been considered insoluble, but 2D MoS2 nanosheets can be susceptible to dissolution, owing to their large surface areas and highly accessible reactive sites, including defects at the basal plane and edge sites. Under light illumination, the dissolution of 2D MoS2 nanosheets can be further accelerated by their photochemical reactivity. To elucidate MoS2 reactivity in the environment, here we investigated the thickness-dependent dissolution of MoS2 under illumination. To synthesize nanoscale thicknesses of MoS2, we exfoliated bulk MoS2 by ultrasonication and controlled the layer thickness by iterative cascade centrifugation, producing MoS2 nanosheets averaging either ?18 nm or ?46 nm thick, depending on the centrifugation rate. Under simulated sunlight, MoS2 dissolution was accelerated, the Mo6+ composition increased, and the solution pH decreased compared to those in the dark. These results suggest that light exposure promotes the oxidation of MoS2, causing faster dissolution. Importantly, 18 nm thick MoS2 exhibited faster dissolution than either 46 nm or bulk MoS2, driven by the superoxide radical (O2-) generation promoted by its relative thinness. These findings highlight the important role of the thickness-dependent photochemistry of MoS2 nanosheets in their dissolution, which is directly linked to their environmental behavior and stability."
10.1021/am506198b,"Two-dimensional MoS2 is a promising material for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its unique electrical and optical properties including the band gap modulation with film thickness. Although MoS2 has shown excellent properties, wafer-scale production with layer control from single to few layers has yet to be demonstrated. The present study explored the large-scale and thickness-modulated growth of atomically thin MoS2 on Si/SiO2 substrates using a two-step sputtering-CVD method. Our process exhibited wafer-scale fabrication and successful thickness modulation of MoS2 layers from monolayer (0.72 nm) to multilayer (12.69 nm) with high uniformity. Electrical measurements on MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs) revealed a p-type semiconductor behavior with much higher field effect mobility and current on/off ratio as compared to previously reported CVD grown MoS2-FETs and amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film transistors. Our results show that sputter-CVD is a viable method to synthesize large-area, high-quality, and layer-controlled MoS2 that can be adapted in conventional Si-based microfabrication technology and future flexible, high-temperature, and radiation hard electronics/optoelectronics."
10.1021/am506198b,"The lower value of FWHM in the case of samples S1 and S2 represents the high structural quality in our MoS2 films. (32) To further confirm the quality and number of MoS2 layers, HRTEM was performed, and Figure 3c,d shows the cross-sectional views of MoS2 layers on Si/SiO2 substrates for samples S1 and S2, respectively. The thickness of the MoS2 layer extracted from HRTEM was found to be 0.69 ± 0.02 nm for sample S1, which confirms the formation of a monolayer, whereas sample S2 shows a clear stacking of 3-4 MoS2 layers. Inset of Figure 3c clearly shows the structure and formation of SL MoS2. The results obtained by HRTEM are found in well agreement with our AFM height profiles and Raman spectra. The formation of voids or discontinuity in SL MoS2 layer (Figure 3c) could be attributed to very low deposition time for Mo atoms to reach substrate surface with sufficiently high energy."
10.1007/s11664-023-10913-w,"We deposited high-quality molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer and multilayer crystals on SiO2/Si substrates, by means of a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process at atmospheric pressure. Notably, NaCl salt was used as component of the precursors to assist the growth of MoS2 crystals, which were intended for use as the active channel layer in the fabrication of field-effect transistors (FETs). The resulting MoS2 crystals from this CVD process were analyzed by optical, scanning electron, and atomic force microscopies, and by Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The optical images and the micrographs obtained by SEM revealed the formation of dispersed MoS2 crystals with a triangular shape all over the SiO2 surface. The thickness of the MoS2 crystals, analyzed by atomic force microscopy, showed minimum values of around 0.7 nm, confirming the formation of monolayers. Additionally, multilayers with larger thickness were also identified. The Raman and photoluminescence spectra of the MoS2 crystals corroborated the formation of single and multiple layers. The fabrication of the FET back-SiO2 -gate configuration was made by depositing patterned source and drain Ti contacts on the dispersed MoS2 crystals to achieve the Ti/MoS2/SiO2/Si layer stacks. MoS2-based FETs with one and three layers were assembled and their electrical response analyzed by I-V output and transfer curves showing the typical characteristics of an n-type semiconductor channel operating in depletion mode. The electrical performance parameters of the devices, such as mobility and threshold voltage, were also determined from this analysis. Finally, to enhance their electrical response, the MoS2-based devices were thermally annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in Ar atmosphere. The increase in the mobility of the device was 176% compared to the device before the treatment."
10.1007/s10853-019-03435-6,"We report an optimized multi-step chemical vapor deposition process for growing MoS2 thin films. This process enables large-area processing, film patterning simply by using shadow masks, and precise control of the final thickness by changing the initial thickness of the first step of MoO3 film deposition. The structural characterization of the MoS2 films is performed with transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction as a function of film thickness. MoS2 film with a thickness of 3 nm possesses a highly crystalline structure with a spacing of 0.62 nm. The crystallinity and orientation of the films are degraded with increased film thickness. Careful analysis by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy reveals that a film with a thickness of 9 nm is not completely sulfurized, and unreacted MoO3 is left at the bottom of the film. These fundamental analyses coincide with the thickness dependence of thin-film transistor (TFT) performance. A TFT with the optimal film thickness of 3 nm achieves high performance, namely a carrier mobility of 0.57 cm2 V-1 s-1 and an on/off ratio of?~?102."
